This is the IntentCode project for the Gemini 3 Hackathon.

It's a snapshot of the origin repo (https://github.com/jfilby/intentcode) where you can see the commit history, plus some last minute changes.

IntentCode is a project named after the pseudo-code that's central to the system.
It's Markdown with a few guidelines and very easy to read and understand.
You can generate it from high-level specs, and the project includes an AI compiler that generates source from the IntentCode.
It's the first of its kind that I know of.

The compiler can be found under src/nextjs/engine
